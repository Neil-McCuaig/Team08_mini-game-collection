# **Team 08’s game: Painter’s Dash**

# **Desired gameplay:**

          We are making a territory painting game. Two players compete to paint as much terrain as they can on a small island. The player who paints more terrain by the end of the time limit wins.   
Players can paint over each other’s territory, so there will be collectable paint bomb power ups that paint over a large space that a vigilant player can use to turn the tide of the game.

# **Objective statement:**

          We want a casually fun, fast paced and low stakes party game experience. We want our game to be something that anyone can pick up and play with a friend and have a quick bit of fun with before moving on with their day.

# **Detail design rationale:**

         We envision players being able to casually have a bit of fun while they wait. Be it students waiting for friends or teammates to arrive, passerby waiting for a meal, or visitors wanting to entertain themselves, our game will make for quick and easy fun for any passerby who wants to play. While it will not be particularly in depth, that will be part of the charm as anyone can have a quick couple of matches and enjoy themselves before moving on with their day.

         We think this will support the overall project by adding a simple and fun competitive game to the roster of available games. It will have a very low level of entry, so anyone should be able to pick up and play it, making it perfect for the broad range of potential players that the project is made for. We also think this will make for an easy to polish project that will make for a good introduction to the Game Development program for anyone who plays. Overall, our game will make for a great addition to the project as a simple and fun experience.
